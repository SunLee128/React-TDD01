## Workflow
- Set up a (very) simple React App with Jest and Enzyme
- Used Enzyme's `shallow()` function to render a component
- Tested that required DOM elements were rendered using `find()`
- Tested state using Enzyme's `setState()`and `state()`
- used `simulate` to interact with rendered elements(clicked button)
- Tested component for updated after interaction
- Created re-usable `setup()` and `findByTestAttr()` functions
